"""

A python decorator for caching the output of a long computation, conditioned on
a matching md5 hash.

This is most useful for scientific pipelines where you process some input data
into an intermediate data structure, then do stuff on the result. Using a single
decorator, this module stores the output of the processing step to a pickle file
after the first time, and will load it each subsequent time.

Basic example:
>>> from functools import partial
>>> cache_decorator = partial(
...      cached_call, expected_hash='7ce738d6b23ecaf840773fb4e7999a0a')
>>> @cache_decorator
... def process(x):
...     print('Computing stuff!')
...     return x
...
>>> process([2, 4, 8])  # This will call process() # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
Could not open file: ...
Hashes did not match ...
Computing stuff!
[2, 4, 8]
>>> process([2, 4, 8])  # This will load from cache.pck # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
Loaded matching data from file (hash = ...)
[2, 4, 8]
>>> import os  # Cleanup doctest
>>> os.remove('cache.pck')
